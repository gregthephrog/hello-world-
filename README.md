This is a file about **me**, i'm using this as an example to help me learn how to use github.
*here* i am attemptinng to use different markdown syntacks, > if i use them often maybe i'll learn it without the cheatsheet.

i'm gonna try listing things out now just to try it, so here goes:
1. i just finished watching bee and puppycat, its **awesome*
2. theres a bunch of syntax so idk if ill use them all 
- i like popcorn 
- and savory food, i think i should just not eat anything but dinner since i only like savory food 
`print("hello world")`
